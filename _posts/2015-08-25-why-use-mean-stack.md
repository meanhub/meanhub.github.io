In earlier post I described What is a MEAN stack. In this post I will give you few good reasons why you should use MEAN stack for developing your next web application.

PROS architecture related
- Strong support for design patterns like MVC, REST API, Client-side MVC
- only JS means less coding standards
- JSON data transfer means easier debugging
- mongodb schema is defined in code, no need to maintain external model of your schema and no more schema migrations
- server independence because nodejs and mongodb is available on all platforms unlike LAMP
- your web server is actually part of your application and hence can be easily installed with your application itself
- SPA
- change from synchronous to asynchronous, event driven
- testing is not an after thought (due to great testing tools & their integration)
- npm

PROS developer related
- less context switch
- only JS so more productivity
-- front enders can understand backend code because all JS

GENERAL PROS
- everything is open source and free
- strong community support (can provide #of SO questions)
- regularly updated and customizable
- already in production at various organizations such as paypal, wallmart

cons
- JavaScript is hard
- steep learning curve
- quite a lot of tools need to master
- debugging is hard
- paradox of choice (too many npm modules but also have lot of options in case one tool stops working can switch to another one easily)
